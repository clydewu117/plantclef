Metric Descriptions:
- mAP: Mean Average Precision across all queries
- Recall@K: Percentage of queries where correct species appears in top-K results

Task Description:
This is a cross-species retrieval task where the model is evaluated on
plant species that were NOT seen during training. The query and gallery
sets contain different species from the training set.
